This README (starting below the line) and the .ply file were downloaded from http://graphics.stanford.edu/pub/3Dscanrep/bunny.tar.gz .

The ply file was converted to a numpy array via 
```
import numpy as np
import open3d as o3d
xyzs = np.asarray(o3d.io.read_point_cloud(
    FindResource("models/bunny/bun_zipper_res2.ply")).points).T
# Center and rotate the raw points.
X_WFile = RigidTransform(RotationMatrix.MakeZRotation(np.pi/2), [0, 0, 0]) @ RigidTransform(RotationMatrix.MakeXRotation(np.pi/2), [0, 0, -0.05])
xyzs = X_WFile.multiply(xyzs)
np.save(FindResource('models/bunny/bunny.npy'), xyzs)
```

These files are the result of reconstructing a set of range images
using the "zipper" program.  The first file is the high resolution
result, while the "_res*" files are decimated versions.  Note that
these decimations were performed using a crude algorithm that does not
necessarily preserve mesh topology.  While they are not beautiful,
they are suitable for interactive rendering.
